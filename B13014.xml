            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a great part of Our Royall care, like as it was of Our</hi> Royall Father of blessed memory deceased, to maintaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Trade of Our Merchants, and the strength of Our Nauie, as principall Veines and Sinewes for the wealth and strength of Our Kingdome. Whereas therefore the Society and Company of Our Eastland Merchants, trading the <hi>Baltique Seas,</hi> haue by the space of fifty yeers at the least, had a setled and constant possession of Trade in those parts, and haue had both the sole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying thither of Our English Commodities, and also the sole bringing in of all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of those Countreys, as namely, Hempe, Yarne, Cable-Yarne, Flaxe, Pot-ashes, Sope-ashes, Polonia Wooll, Cordage, Eastland Linnen Cloth, Pitch, Tarre, and Wood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Our Kingdome hath been much enriched, Our Shippes and Mariners set on worke, and the honour and fame of Our Nation and Kingdome, spread and enlarged in those parts.</p>
            <p>And whereas for their further encouragement, the said Company haue had and enioyed by Letters Patents vnder the great Seale of England, in the time of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Priuiledges, aswell for the sole carrying out to those Countreys of all Our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

            <p>Wee minding the vpholding and continuance of the sayd Trade, and not to suffer that the said Society shall sustaine any violation, or diminution of their Liberties &amp; Priuiledges, haue thought good to ratifie and publish vnto all persons, as well Subiects as Strangers, the sayd Priuiledges and Restraints, to the end that none of them presume to attempt any thing against the same.</p>
            <p>And We doe hereby straitly charge and command all Our Customers, Comptrollers, and all other Our Officers at the Ports, and also the Farmers of Our Customes, and their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Wayters, that they suffer not any Broad Cloth, Dozens, Kerseys, Bayes, Skins, or such like English Commodities, to bee shipped for exportation to those parts, nor any Hempe, Flaxe, dressed or vndressed, Yarne, Cable-Yarne, Cordage, Pot-ashes, Sope-ashes, Polonia-wooll, Eastland-Linnen-cloth, Pitch, Tarre, or Wood, or any other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoeuer of those Forreyne parts and Regions, wherein the sayd Company haue vsed to trade, to be Landed, except onely such as shall be brought in by such as are free of the said Company.

            <p>Furthermore, whereas there hath been in ancient time diuers good and politique Lawes made against the shipping of Merchandize in Strangers Bottomes, either Inward or Outward, as namely the Statutes of <hi>5.
